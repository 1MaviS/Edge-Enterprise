## About this early preview

The early preview will include some visual treatments for the work profile, a lightly managed personal profile, and automatic switching between work and personal profiles for a limited number of websites.

To enable the early preview, users need to use Microsoft Edge version 112 or higher.
Users can enable different aspects of the early preview with the following flags:
- *edge://flags/#edge-project-kodiak* (overall experience)
- *edge://flags/#edge-project-kodiak-look-and-feel* (work browser visual treatment)
- *edge://flags/#edge-project-kodiak-policy-filter* (lightly managed personal profile)
- *edge://flags/#edge-automatic-profile-switching* (automatic switching)

## The Microsoft Edge for Business user experience

Configuring and activating the user experience is straight forward and easy to do. First, the user opens Microsoft Edge on a work device to launch Microsoft Edge for Business. The next step is to enable the personal browser window in the profile flyout. After this one-time set up the user can start browsing as normal. Work related sites such as sites that need a user's work login and Microsoft 365 apps and services, will automatically open in the work browser window. A growing set of popular sites will automatically open in the personal browser window.

### Enable personal browsing for users

The personal browsing option will be enabled by default, and users will have the option to create a personal browser profile. You can turn off the personal profile with a policy that prevents Microsoft Edge from creating a new profile. If you've already configured this policy, then the personal browsing option will not be available to your users.

### Enable automatic switching for users

Automatic switching is enabled by default. There will be a separate automatic switching policy that can be disabled.

## Security and Compliance

The personal browser will have the same security and compliance posture as Microsoft Edge for Business. Controls for security and compliance will remain with IT, whether the user has Microsoft Edge for Business or the personal browser open.
