# Microsoft Edge Enterprise new tab page

The Enterprise new tab page is a direct response to a new challenge that workers face daily: frequent context switching. Our research shows that in addition to managing schedules, workers juggle roughly three projects a day — and on average, switch between them two to three times a day. Couple that with a torrent of emails, pings, and calls (which, when combined, can easily number in the triple digits) and they’re constantly switching contexts throughout their day. Finally, add on the challenge of hybrid workplaces and it’s no wonder they want to work smarter not harder.

## The role of the browser

As the browser role grows to become central for workers to finish everyday tasks, it’s more important now than ever that information workers can cut through the noise and find what they need. That’s why we’ve created a personalized productivity dashboard right in the Microsoft Edge Enterprise new tab page. Any enterprise user of Microsoft Edge can use this by simply opening a new tab and then selecting the **Microsoft 365** tab.

This dashboard is a focal point for quickly finding the information you need and stay up to date on the things that matter most, all while cutting out the noise. Now, we’ll highlight some of the top features that can help keep your employees productive.

We’re continuously looking to improve the browser experience so we want to get your feedback, which you can provide by pressing alt + shift + I to open the **Send feedback** dialog where you can share your thoughts.

## Microsoft 365 feed

Do you feel overwhelmed by trying to keep up with all the updates at work? The Microsoft 365 feed is personalized to you and your work. This feed uses Microsoft 365 data to bring you the most important information happening around your organization. From at mentions, to files being edited, to meeting recordings you might want to catch-up on, to colleague promotions, and so much more. This experience helps keep you up to date on the most important information at a glance.

## Recent SharePoint sites card

Tired of jumping through hoops to get to your SharePoint sites? Here’s a shortcut to help you get the information you need to be productive, even faster.

## Quick Access list

Our research shows that information workers can handle tens, if not hundreds of files over a given week. This can get overwhelming when you don’t know where each file is saved or who sent it to you. This module ranks files we think are most important to you to help you find them quickly. Don’t see them here? That’s okay, you can either use our new Work Search features (information later) to look up the file name or the name of the colleague who sent it to you, or use the link at the bottom of the list to hop to Office.com and find it there.

## Upcoming events card

One of the most important aspects of keeping up with a fast-paced work environment is knowing what meetings you have coming up and when they're scheduled. As if it wasn’t hard difficult enough to begin with, hybrid work has increased the number of meetings for many workers, causing overload. No productivity dashboard is complete without a glanceable calendar to make sure you’re prepared for your meetings. And with one click you can join your Teams meeting or send a message to other attendees if you happen to be running late.
