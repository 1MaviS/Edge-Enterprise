# Microsoft Edge Enterprise new tab page

The Enterprise new tab page is a direct response to a new challenge that workers face daily: frequent context switching. Our research indicates that in addition to managing schedules, workers juggle roughly three projects a day — and on average, switch between them two to three times a day. Couple that with a torrent of emails, pings, and calls (which, when combined, can easily number in the triple digits) and they’re constantly switching contexts throughout their day. Finally, pile on the difficulty of hybrid workplaces and it’s no wonder they want to work smarter not harder.

## The role of the browser

As the browser becomes central for workers to finish everyday tasks, it’s more important now than ever that information workers can cut through the noise and find what they need. That’s why we’ve created a personalized productivity dashboard right in the Microsoft Edge Enterprise new tab page. Any enterprise user of Microsoft Edge can use this by simply opening a new tab and then selecting the **Microsoft 365** tab.

This dashboard is a focal point for quickly finding the information you need and stay up to date on the things that matter most, all while cutting out the noise. Now, we’ll highlight some of the top features that can help keep your employees productive.

We’re continuously looking to improve the browser experience so we want to get your feedback, which you can provide by pressing alt + shift + I to open the **Send feedback** dialog where you can share your thoughts.
