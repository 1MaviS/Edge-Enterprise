# Microsoft Edge management service

The Microsoft Edge management service is an area in the M365 admin center where admins can configure Microsoft Edge browser settings for their organization. These configurations are stored in the cloud and you can apply these settings to the browser using group assignment or group policy. Users must be logged into Microsoft Edge to retrieve these settings.

> [!NOTE]
> This experience is in public preview. We'll start rolling out this experience on May 23 and expect to finish the rollout by the end of that week. You'll need to set up a Targeted release to opt in and view this experience in the M365 admin center.

## Set up a Targeted release

There are two parts to setting up a Targeted release: identifying release preferences and picking the users for the release preference you configure.

Use the following steps as a guide to set up a Targeted release:

1. Sign into the Microsoft 365 admin center and then go to **Settings** > **Org settings**. Under the **Organization profile** tab, choose **Release preferences**. This window gives several release options: standard for everyone,  targeted for everyone, and targeted for selected users.
1. To enable a targeted release for all the users in your organization, select **Targeted release for everyone**, and then select **Save changes**.
1. To enable a targeted release for some people in your organization, select **Targeted release for selected users**, and then select **Save changes**. After you set up the release you want, the next step is to add the users for the release.
1. Choose **Select users** to add users one at a time, or **Upload users** to add them in bulk.
1. When you finish adding users, select **Save changes**.
