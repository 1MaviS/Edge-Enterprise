Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#august-25-2023).

### Feature update

- **Tab organization.**  Microsoft Edge offers helpful suggestions on how to organize tabs to save you time and keep you focused on the web content you care about. These suggestions augment the Tab Grouping feature built into Microsoft Edge. When two or more tabs are grouped together, Microsoft Edge can automatically generate a relevant name for the Tab Group. Furthermore, Microsoft Edge can suggest grouping for all of your tabs by using the "Group Similar Tabs" feature in the Tab Action menu. Administrators can control the availability of this feature using the [TabServicesEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#tabservicesenabled) policy.

## Version 116.0.1938.54: August 21, 2023

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#august-21-2023).

### Feature update

- **Microsoft Edge for Business.** With native enterprise grade security, productivity, manageability, and AI built in, Edge for Business enables organizations to maximize productivity and security, and offers the ability to create separation between work and personal browsing with automatic switching between the lightly managed personal browser window (MSA profile) and the work browser window (Microsoft Entra ID). All users signing in with their Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) will automatically receive Edge for Business and see an updated Edge icon with a briefcase to designate they're in the work browser window. For more information, [read our FAQ](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-edge-insider/microsoft-edge-for-business-faq/ba-p/3891837).

- **Option to attach the Edge sidebar to the Windows desktop.** Users of the Microsoft Edge sidebar will be able to access their apps and sites directly from their Windows 10 desktop. As an opt-in experience in Windows 10, users can attach the sidebar to their Windows desktop by clicking a "popout" icon near the base of the sidebar in the browser. This enables a side-by-side experience that works with any Windows app â€” including Microsoft Edge itself. Users enjoy streamlined access to the same set of powerful AI tools and web-based services, including Bing Chat, without launching a browser window, enhancing productivity regardless of where they are in Windows. Additional features and options are planned in future versions of Microsoft Edge. Administrators can control the availability of this feature using the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled) policy.
