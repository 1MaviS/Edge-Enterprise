### Feature updates

- **Use the current profile to sign into websites when multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device.** When multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device, users will be asked to choose an account from the account picker to continue their visits to websites. In this release, users will be prompted to let Microsoft Edge sign in to the websites automatically with the work or school account that's signed into the current profile. Users can turn this feature on and off in **Settings** > **Profile preferences**.

- **Add support for Microsoft Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) on macOS.** Microsoft Endpoint DLP policy enforcement will be available natively on macOS.

- **Automatic HTTPS.** Users can upgrade navigations from HTTP to HTTPS on domains likely to support this more secure protocol. This support can also be configured to attempt delivery over HTTPS for all domains. Note: This feature is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you donâ€™t see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Block WebSQL in 3rd-party contexts.** Use of the legacy WebSQL feature will be blocked from 3rd-party frames. The [WebSQLInThirdPartyContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#websqlinthirdpartycontextenabled) policy is available as an opt-out option until Microsoft Edge version 101. This change is happening in the Chromium project that Microsoft Edge is based on. For more information, see this [Chrome Platform Status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5684870116278272) entry.

- **Citations in Microsoft Edge.** Citing sources for research is a common requirement for students. They have to manage many research references and sources, which aren't easy tasks. They also have to translate these citations to proper citation formats like APA, MLA, and Chicago. This new "Citations" feature, now in Preview in Microsoft Edge, gives students a better way to manage and generate citations as they research online. With Citations turned on in Collections or from **Settings and more (Alt-F)**, Microsoft Edge automatically generates citations that students can use later so they can stay focused on their research. When they're done, they can easily compile these citations into a final deliverable. For more information, see [Previewing Citations in Microsoft Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/11/04/preview-citations-feature-edge/).

- **Control Flow Guard (CFG).** Microsoft Edge will start supporting more fine-grained protection by combating memory corruption vulnerabilities and by protecting indirect calls. CFG is only supported with Windows 8 and later. For more information, see [Control Flow Guard](/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard).
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > This is an evolving technology, please share your feedback to help us strengthen its support.

### Feature updates

- **Cloud Site List Management for IE mode in Public Preview.** Cloud Site List Management lets you manage your site lists for IE mode in the cloud without needing an on-premises infrastructure to host your organization's site list. You can access the Cloud Site List Management feature using the Microsoft Edge Site Lists experience in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. To learn more, see the [Cloud Site List Management for IE mode (Public Preview)](./edge-ie-mode-cloud-site-list-mgmt.md) article.
  
- **Improved handoff between IE mode and the modern browser.** Starting with this version of Microsoft Edge, navigations between Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer mode will include form data and additional HTTP headers. Referrer headers, post data, forms data, and request methods will be forwarded correctly across the two experiences. You can specify which data types should be included using the InternetExplorerIntegrationComplexNavDataTypes policy. For more information, see this FAQ: [My application requires transferring POST data between IE mode and Microsoft Edge. Is this supported?](./edge-ie-mode-faq.md#my-application-requires-transferring-post-data-between-ie-mode-and-microsoft-edge-is-this-supported)

- **Update Microsoft Edge WebWiew2 using WSUS.** IT Admins using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to update Microsoft Edge will also be able to update Microsoft Edge WebView2 using WSUS. This capability gives admins an easier servicing process for offline devices.

- **WSUS updates for Server.** WSUS and Catalog updates for Microsoft Edge channels (Stable, Beta, and Dev) will now apply to Windows Server SKUs that have Microsoft Edge installed, including Windows Server 2022. For more information on how to configure WSUS updates for Microsoft Edge, see [Update Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/deploy-edge?bc=https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/breadcrumb/toc.json&toc=https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/toc.json#update-microsoft-edge).

- **Microsoft Edge AutoLaunch Protocols Component.** Microsoft Edge 96 introduces the AutoLaunch Protocols [Component](https://textslashplain.com/2019/07/16/updating-browsers-quickly-flags-respins-and-components/) that contains lists of scheme-origin dictionaries to automatically allow or block. This protects customers from dangerous schemes (for example, a protocol handler with a 0-day) while eliminating prompts from known-safe pairings (for example, the Teams website can open the Teams client app). If for some reason, you don't want Microsoft Edge to block vulnerable protocol handlers and allow known-safe pairings, use the toggle in *edge://settings/content/applicationLinks*, or set the [AutoLaunchProtocolsComponentEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autolaunchprotocolscomponentenabled) policy to False.

- **Launch Progressive Web App (PWA) directly via protocol links.** Let installed PWAs handle links that use a specific protocol for a more integrated experience.

- **Quickly view Office files in the browser.** Users can now view Office files including documents, spreadsheets, and presentations that they come across while browsing on Microsoft Edge right in the browser without needing to download the file and then open it in a different application. There will be no changes in the file open experience for Office files that are hosted on OneDrive or SharePoint.
  
- **Freeform highlighting on PDFs.** The PDF viewing and markup experience is improved with the addition of freeform highlighters. You can highlight sections in PDFs that you don't have access to, and scanned documents.

- **Hardware-enforced Stack Protection.** Microsoft Edge will begin supporting an even safer browsing mode that uses hardware-dependent control flow for browser processes on supported hardware (Intel 11th Gen. or AMD Zen 3). Note: Because this is a Controlled Feature Rollout you may not notice this feature enabled on all devices. You can enable or disable Hardware-enforced Stack Protection by manipulating Image File Execution Options (IFEO) using group policy.

- **New warning dialog for typosquatting sites.** The browser will show a warning on some sites with URLs that look very similar to other sites. This UI uses client-side heuristics to warn users about sites that might be spoofing popular web sites. For more information, see [What is typosquatting?](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/what-is-typosquatting-54a18872-8459-4d47-b3e3-d84d9a362eb0).
  
- **Dictionary added to mini-toolbar in Immersive Reader.**  We're adding dictionary functionality to the mini-toolbar to assist in your reading and research. You'll be able to look up the spelling and definitions of words more quickly and easily in the Immersive Reader experience.
  
- **Learn how to solve math problems with Math Solver.** Weâ€™re excited to announce that you can use Math Solver in Microsoft Edge to get help with a wide range of mathematical concepts. These concepts range from elementary arithmetic and quadratic equations to trigonometry and calculus. Math Solver lets you take a picture of a handwritten or printed math problem and then provides an instant solution with step-by-step instructions to help you learn how to reach the solution without help. Math Solver also comes with a mathematical keyboard that you can use to easily type math problems. This keyboard eliminates the need to search around a traditional keyboard to find the math characters you need. After solving your problem, Math Solver provides options to continue learning with quizzes, worksheets, and video tutorials.

- **Split tunnel VPN support for WebRTC.** Allows enterprise customers to gain the benefit of VPN split tunneling for peer-to-peer traffic on Microsoft Edge. You can enable this feature using the [WebRtcRespectOsRoutingTableEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#webrtcrespectosroutingtableenabled) policy.

### Feature updates

- **View in File Explorer support for SharePoint Online libraries in Microsoft Edge.**  Now you can enable the View in File Explorer capability on SharePoint Online Modern Document Libraries. For this experience to be visible and work for your users, you need to enable the Microsoft Edge policy [Configure the View in File Explorer feature for SharePoint pages in Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#configureviewinfileexplorer) and update your SharePoint Online tenant configuration. Learn more: [View SharePoint files with File Explorer in Microsoft Edge](/SharePoint/sharepoint-view-in-edge).

- **Intranet zone file URL links will open in Windows File Explorer.**  You can allow file URL links to intranet zone files originating from intranet zone HTTPS websites to open Windows File Explorer for that file or directory. You can enable this experience using the [IntranetFileLinksEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#intranetfilelinksenabled) policy.

- **Improvements to the downloads experience.** Support for the download user experience is extended to progressive web applications PWAs and WebView. We will also begin to support drag and drop to the File Explorer and Desktop.

- **Pick up where you left off on PDF documents.**  You will now be able to resume reading from where you last closed your PDF document.

- **Efficiency mode extends battery life when your laptop enters battery saver mode.**  Efficiency mode will become active when your laptop enters battery saver mode to allow the browser to manage resource usage to extend the battery life of your machine. You will have four options when efficiency mode becomes active: Unplugged and low battery, Unplugged, Always, and Never. Note: This feature is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you donâ€™t see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Free form text boxes added to PDF documents.** We now support adding free form text boxes to PDF documents. You can use these boxes to fill in forms and add visible notes.

- **Citation support added to Collections.**  We've improved the Collections experience, especially for students and researchers. Collections will start supporting citations and reading lists.

- **Update your passwords faster and with fewer clicks.** The browser will now take you directly to the Change Password page for a given website. This action saves you time and clicks by removing the need to navigate to the page manually. After youâ€™re on this page, the browser will also autofill your existing password and suggest a strong, unique new password.  Note: Currently this feature is only available on a limited number of sites.

- **Auto-account creation.** We now provide additional support on Sign-Up pages by allowing you to create an online account with one click. You can do this by selecting the suggestion drop-down when you click on any form field in the Sign-Up form. Doing so will show not only information relevant to the Sign-Up form, but also a strong new password suggestion. Upon selection, all the relevant information gets populated in the respective fields and the suggested password will be automatically stored on submission to the website. Note: Currently this feature is only available on a limited number of sites.
