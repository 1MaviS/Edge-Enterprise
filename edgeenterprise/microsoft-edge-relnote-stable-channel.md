### Feature updates

- **Upcoming three-digit version number in user agent string.** Starting with version 100, Microsoft Edge will send a three-digit version number in the User-Agent header, for example "Edg/100". Starting with Microsoft Edge 97, site owners can test this upcoming agent string by enabling the **#force-major-version-to-100** experiment flag in *edge://flags* to ensure their User-Agent parsing logic is robust and works as expected.

- **Personalize multi-profile experiences with profile preferences for sites.** Users can personalize their multi-profile experience with the ability to create a customized list of sites for automatic profile switching in Microsoft Edge.

- **Navigate PDF documents using page thumbnails.** You'll now be able to navigate through your PDF document using thumbnails that represent the pages. These thumbnails will appear in the pane on the left side of the PDF reader.

- **Configure the list of domains for which the password manager User Interface (UI) for Save and Fill will be disabled.** Use the [PasswordManagerBlocklist](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#passwordmanagerblocklist) policy to configure the list of domains (HTTP/HTTPS schemas and hostnames only) where Microsoft Edge should disable the password manager. This means that Save and Fill workflows will be disabled, which ensures that passwords for those websites canâ€™t be saved or auto filled into web forms.

- **Custom primary password.** The browser already has the capability where users can add an authentication step before saved passwords are auto filled in web forms. This adds another layer of privacy and helps prevent unauthorized users from using saved passwords to log on websites. Custom primary password is an evolution of that same feature, where users will now be able to use a custom string of their choice as their primary password. After it's enabled, users will enter this password to authenticate themselves and have their saved passwords auto filled into web forms.

### Feature updates

- **Enhance your security on the web.** This is a browsing mode in Microsoft Edge where browser security takes priority, giving users an extra layer of protection when browsing the web. Administrators can apply group policies to end-user desktops (Windows, macOS, and Linux) to help protect against in-the-wild exploits (also referred to 0-days). The following group policies support this browsing mode:

  - [EnhanceSecurityMode](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymode)
  - [EnhanceSecurityModeBypassListDomains](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymodebypasslistdomains)
  - [EnhanceSecurityModeEnforceListDomains](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymodeenforcelistdomains)

- **Upcoming three-digit version number in user agent string.** Starting with version 100, Microsoft Edge will send a three-digit version number in the User-Agent header, for example "Edg/**100**". Starting with Microsoft Edge 97, site owners can test this upcoming user agent string by enabling the **#force-major-version-to-100** experiment flag in *edge://flags* to ensure their User-Agent parsing logic is robust and works as expected.

- **Deprecate WebRTC's Plan B SDP semantics.** This change deprecates a legacy Session Description Protocol (SDP) dialect called Plan B. This SDP format is being replaced by the Unified Plan, which is a spec-compliant and cross-browser compatible SDP format. For more information, see the Chrome Platform Status entry [PSA: Plan B should throw in M96 Beta and Stable](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5823036655665152), and [PSA: Plan B throwing in Stable and Extended Deprecation Trial End Date](https://groups.google.com/g/discuss-webrtc/c/gEHrZyYKsfU). Requesting a [Trial for RTCPeerConnection Plan B SDP Semantics](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/3892235977954951169) allows sites to continue to use the deprecated API until version 101.

- **Overlay scrollbars added to Microsoft Edge.** We've updated our scrollbars with an overlay-based design. Users can turn this feature on in *edge://flags*.

### Feature updates

- **Use the current profile to sign into websites when multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device.** When multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device, users will be asked to choose an account from the account picker to continue their visits to websites. In this release, users will be prompted to let Microsoft Edge sign in to the websites automatically with the work or school account that's signed into the current profile. Users can turn this feature on and off in **Settings** > **Profile preferences**.

- **Add support for Microsoft Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) on macOS.** Microsoft Endpoint DLP policy enforcement will be available natively on macOS.

- **Automatic HTTPS.** Users can upgrade navigations from HTTP to HTTPS on domains likely to support this more secure protocol. This support can also be configured to attempt delivery over HTTPS for all domains. Note: This feature is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you donâ€™t see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Block WebSQL in 3rd-party contexts.** Use of the legacy WebSQL feature will be blocked from 3rd-party frames. The [WebSQLInThirdPartyContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#websqlinthirdpartycontextenabled) policy is available as an opt-out option until Microsoft Edge version 101. This change is happening in the Chromium project that Microsoft Edge is based on. For more information, see this [Chrome Platform Status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5684870116278272) entry.

- **Citations in Microsoft Edge.** Citing sources for research is a common requirement for students. They have to manage many research references and sources, which aren't easy tasks. They also have to translate these citations to proper citation formats like APA, MLA, and Chicago. This new "Citations" feature, now in Preview in Microsoft Edge, gives students a better way to manage and generate citations as they research online. With Citations turned on in Collections or from **Settings and more (Alt-F)**, Microsoft Edge automatically generates citations that students can use later so they can stay focused on their research. When they're done, they can easily compile these citations into a final deliverable. For more information, see [Previewing Citations in Microsoft Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/11/04/preview-citations-feature-edge/).

- **Control Flow Guard (CFG).** Microsoft Edge will start supporting more fine-grained protection by combating memory corruption vulnerabilities and by protecting indirect calls. CFG is only supported with Windows 8 and later. For more information, see [Control Flow Guard](/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard).
