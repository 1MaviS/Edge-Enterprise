# Self-host Microsoft Edge extensions

This article provides basic guidance for packaging an extension to host on your own webstore. It also includes instructions on how to deploy extensions to devices and users in your organization.

## Prerequisites

To self-host your own extensions, you will need to provide your own web hosting services for the extensions and their manifest files.

 The following steps assume that you’ve already created your extension, have some experience with XML files, have a working knowledge of configuring group policy, and know how to use the Windows registry.

## Publish an extension

Before you publish an extension it needs to be packed into a CRX file. Use the following steps as a guide to packing an extension as a CRX file.

## Publish updates to an extension

## Distribute a privately hosted extension

If you aren’t using the Admin console, you can use the policy called "Configure the list of force installed apps and extensions" to force-install an extension on your user's device.
