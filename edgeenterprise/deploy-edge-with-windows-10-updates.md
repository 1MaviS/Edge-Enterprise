# Deploy Microsoft Edge with Windows 10 updates

The article provides information for users who are deploying Microsoft Edge by using Windows 10 updates.

## For Windows 10 release 20H2

Windows 10 version 20H2 already has Microsoft Edge installed as its default browser.

## For Windows 10 releases RS4 through 20H1

Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) has updates for each version of Windows 10 from RS4 through 20H1 that will remove the Microsoft Edge Legacy desktop app and replace it with Microsoft Edge. For more information, see [this support article](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/update-in-wsus-for-the-new-microsoft-edge-for-windows-10-version-1809-1903-1909-and-2004-october-29-2020-b4980418-4ec4-dee7-3b17-1c6499bd127c) to find out which WSUS update is right for your Windows version.

## For Windows 10 releases prior to RS4 (and Windows 7, 8.1, and earlier)

Windows updates to install Microsoft Edge aren't available for these versions. Consider other options for deploying Microsoft Edge to these devices such as [Configuration Manager](/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/deploy-edge?bc=https%3a%2f%2fdocs.microsoft.com%2fDeployEdge%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=https%3a%2f%2fdocs.microsoft.com%2fDeployEdge%2ftoc.json) or [Intune](/intune/apps/apps-windows-edge/?bc=https%3a%2f%2fdocs.microsoft.com%2fDeployEdge%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=https%3a%2f%2fdocs.microsoft.com%2fDeployEdge%2ftoc.json).
