### Feature updates

- **Ability to control automatic profile switching.** The [GuidedSwitchEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#guidedswitchenabled) policy lets Microsoft Edge prompt the user to switch to the appropriate profile when Microsoft Edge detects that a link is a personal or work link.

- **Client Certificate Switcher.** This feature will offer a way for users to clear the remembered certificate and resurface the certificate picker when visiting a site requiring http certificate authentication. Switching can be done without manually quitting Microsoft Edge.

- **More reliable web defense.** Browse the web with more reliable protection thanks to the rewritten [Microsoft Defender SmartScreen](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-smartscreen) library for Microsoft Edge on Windows.
