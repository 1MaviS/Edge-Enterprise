# Release notes for Microsoft Edge Beta Channel

These release notes provide information about new features and non-security updates that are included in the Microsoft Edge Beta Channel. Archived versions of these release notes are available at [Archived release notes for Microsoft Edge Beta Channel](./microsoft-edge-relnote-archive-beta-channel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Edge Web Platform constantly evolves to improve user experience, security, and privacy. To learn more, see [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes).

## Version 97.0.1072.28: December 8

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

## Version 97.0.1072.21: December 1

### Feature updates

- **Use current profile to sign into websites when multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device.** When multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device, users will be asked to choose an account from the account picker to continue their visits to websites. In this release, users will be prompted to allow Microsoft Edge to sign in to the websites automatically with the work and school account signed into current profile. Users can turn this feature on and off in **Settings/Profile preferences**.

- **Add support for Microsoft Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) on MacOS.** Microsoft Endpoint DLP policy enforcement is available natively on MacOS.

- **Open digitally signed PDF files.**  Digital signatures are used extensively to validate the authenticity of, and changes to, a document. Users will be able to validate the signatures for PDF files directly from the browser, without the need for any add-ins.

- **Citations in Microsoft Edge.** Citing sources for research is a common requirement for students. They have to manage many research references and sources, which is no easy task. They also have to translate these citations to proper citation formats like APA, MLA, and Chicago. This new "Citations" feature in Microsoft Edge (now in Preview) gives students a better way to manage and generate citations as they research online. With Citations turned on in Collections or from **Settings and more (Alt-F)**, Microsoft Edge automatically generates citations that students can use later so they can stay focussed on their research. When they're done they can easily compile these citations into a final deliverable. For more information, see [Previewing Citations in Microsoft Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/11/04/preview-citations-feature-edge/).

### Feature updates

- **Launch Progressive Web App (PWA) directly via protocol links.** Let installed PWAs handle links that use a specific protocol for a more integrated experience.

- **Learn how to solve math problems with Math Solver.** Weâ€™re excited to announce that you can use Math Solver in Microsoft Edge to get help with a wide range of mathematical concepts. These concepts range from elementary arithmetic and quadratic equations to trigonometry and calculus. Math Solver lets you take a picture of a handwritten or printed math problem and then provides an instant solution with step-by-step instructions to help you learn how to reach the solution without help. Math Solver also comes with a mathematical keyboard that you can use to easily type math problems. This keyboard eliminates the need to search around a traditional keyboard to find the math characters you need. After solving your problem, Math Solver provides options to continue learning with quizzes, worksheets, and video tutorials.

- **Freeform highlighting on PDFs.** The PDF viewing and markup experience is improved with the addition of freeform highlighters. You can highlight sections in PDFs that you don't have access to, and scanned documents.

- **Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET).**  Microsoft Edge will begin supporting an even safer browsing mode that uses hardware-dependent control flow for browser processes on supported hardware (Intel 11th Gen. or AMD Zen 3). Note: Because this is a Controlled Feature Rollout you may not notice this feature enabled on all devices. You can enable or disable CET by manipulating Image File Execution Options (IFEO) using group policy.

- **New warning dialog for typosquatting sites.** The browser will now show a warning on some sites with URLs that look very similar to other sites. This UI uses client-side heuristics to warn users about sites that might be spoofing popular web sites. For more information, see [What is typosquatting?](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/what-is-typosquatting-54a18872-8459-4d47-b3e3-d84d9a362eb0).

- **Improved handoff between IE mode and the modern browser.**  Starting with this version of Microsoft Edge, navigations between Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer mode will include form data and additional HTTP headers. Referrer headers, post data, forms data, and request methods will be forwarded correctly across the two experiences. You can specify which data types should be included using the [InternetExplorerIntegrationComplexNavDataTypes](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationcomplexnavdatatypes) policy. For more information, see this FAQ: [My application requires transferring POST data between IE mode and Microsoft Edge](./edge-ie-mode-faq.md#my-application-requires-transferring-post-data-between-ie-mode-and-microsoft-edge-is-this-supported).

- **Cloud Site List Management for IE mode in Public Preview.**  Cloud Site List Management lets you manage your site lists for IE mode in the cloud without needing an on-premises infrastructure to host your organization's site list. You can access the Cloud Site List Management feature using the Microsoft Edge Site Lists experience in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. To learn more, see the [Cloud Site List Management for IE mode (Public Preview)](./edge-ie-mode-cloud-site-list-mgmt.md) article.

- **Update Microsoft Edge WebWiew2 using WSUS.** IT Admins using WSUS to update Microsoft Edge will also be able to update Microsoft Edge WebView2 using WSUS. This capability gives admins an easier servicing process for offline devices.

- **WSUS updates for Server.** WSUS and Catalog updates for Microsoft Edge channels (Stable, Beta, Dev) will now apply to Windows Server SKUs that have Microsoft Edge installed, including Windows Server 2022. For more information on how to configure WSUS updates for Microsoft Edge, see [Update Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/deploy-edge?bc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2FDeployEdge%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&toc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2FDeployEdge%2Ftoc.json#update-microsoft-edge).
