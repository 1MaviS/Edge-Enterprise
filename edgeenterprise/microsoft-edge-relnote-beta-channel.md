## Version 115.0.1823.xx: June x, 2023

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

### Feature update

- **Enhanced security mode improvements.** Enhanced security mode provides an extra layer of protection when browsing the web and visiting less familiar sites. Enhanced security mode is turned on by default to Balanced mode for x64 Windows, x64 macOS, x64 Linux, and ARM64 systems. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout in Microsoft Edge Beta 115. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

  Also, administrators have 2 new policies to manage the Enhanced security mode user experience: [EnhanceSecurityModeIndicatorUIEnabled] and [EnhanceSecurityModeOptOutUXEnabled].  For more information, see [Browse more safely with Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-browse-safer).

- **Microsoft Edge management service.** Microsoft Edge management service is an area in the M365 admin center where admins can manage the Microsoft Edge browser. It is a simple and easy-to-manage experience. Admins will be able to configure all Microsoft Edge browser policies for their organization in a configuration profile and set-up the browser to use these settings. <!-- For more information, see [link to Dan's doc].--> **Note:** This experience is in public preview. We'll start rolling out this experience on June 5 and expect to finish the rollout by the end of that week. You'll need to set up a Targeted release to opt in and view this experience in the M365 admin center.

### Feature update

- **(Preview) Microsoft Edge Workspaces.** Edge Workspaces gives customers a way to organize their browsing tasks into dedicated windows. Edge Workspaces lets users share a set of browser tabs so working groups can view the same websites and latest working files in one place and stay on the same page. Each Edge Workspace contains its own sets of tabs and favorites, created and curated by the user and their collaborators. Edge Workspaces are automatically saved and kept up to date. For more information about this public preview, see [Microsoft Edge Workspaces](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-workspaces).

- **Option to attach the Edge sidebar to the Windows desktop.**  Users of the Microsoft Edge sidebar will be able to access their apps and sites directly from their Windows desktop. As an opt-in experience, users can attach the sidebar to their Windows desktop by clicking a "popout" icon near the base of the sidebar in the browser. This enables a side-by-side experience that works with any Windows appâ€”including Microsoft Edge itself. Users enjoy streamlined access to the same set of powerful AI tools and web-based services, including Bing Chat, without launching a browser window, enhancing productivity regardless of where they are in Windows. Administrators can control the availability using the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled).

- **Enhanced security mode on by default.** Enhanced security mode provides an extra layer of protection when browsing the web and visiting less familiar sites. Enhanced security mode is turned on by default for x64 Windows, x64 macOS, x64 Linux, and ARM64 systems. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.
