# Release notes for Microsoft Edge Beta Channel

These release notes provide information about new features and non-security updates that are included in the Microsoft Edge Beta Channel. Archived versions of these release notes are available [here](microsoft-edge-relnote-archive-beta-channel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Edge Web Platform constantly evolves to improve user experience, security, and privacy. To learn more, see [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes).

## Version 95.0.1020.9: September 28

### Feature updates

- **View in File Explorer support for SharePoint Online libraries in Microsoft Edge.**  Now you can enable the View in File Explorer capability on SharePoint Online Modern Document Libraries. For this experience to be visible and work for your users, you will need to enable the Microsoft Edge policy ["Configure the View in File Explorer feature for SharePoint pages in Microsoft Edge"](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#configureviewinfileexplorer) and update your SharePoint Online tenant configuration. Learn more: [View SharePoint files with File Explorer in Microsoft Edge - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Docs](/SharePoint/sharepoint-view-in-edge).

- **Intranet zone file URL links will open in Windows File Explorer.**  You can allow file URL links to intranet zone files originating from intranet zone HTTPS websites to open Windows File Explorer for that file or directory. You can enable this experience using the IntranetFileLinksEnabled policy.

- **Improvements to the downloads experience.**  Support for the download user experience is being extended to progressive web applications PWAs and WebView. We will also begin to support drag and drop to the File Explorer and Desktop.

- **Pick up where you left off on PDF documents.**  You will now be able to resume reading from where you last closed your PDF document.

- **Efficiency mode extends battery life when your laptop enters battery saver mode.**  Efficiency mode will become active when your laptop enters battery saver mode to allow the browser to manage resource usage to extend the battery life of your machine. You will have four options for when efficiency mode becomes active, Unplugged and low battery, Unplugged, Always, and Never. Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout. Devices with a battery should have the feature turned on.

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge moving to a 4-week cadence for updates in Beta and Stable channels.**  We will adopt a new, 4-week release cycle for major versions. You can read more about the decision here: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/03/12/new-release-cycles-microsoft-edge-extended-stable/

- **New Extended stable option being offered.**  We are offering a new Extended Stable option to our managed Enterprise customers. The Extended Stable option will stay on even numbered revisions and update every 8 weeks. There will be a biweekly security update.  Additional information here: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/07/15/opt-in-extended-stable-release-cycle/

- **Improvements to default behavior of opening MHTML files.**  MHTML files will continue to open in IE mode if IE mode is enabled, unless the MHTML file was saved from Microsoft Edge (using the Save As or Save Page As options in Microsoft Edge). If the file was saved from Microsoft Edge, it will now open in Microsoft Edge.  This change will fix a rendering issue that was observed when opening an MHTML file in IE mode when saved from Microsoft Edge.

- **Restrict private network requests to secure contexts.** Access to resources on local (intranet) networks from pages on the internet requires that those pages be delivered over HTTPS. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5436853517811712). Two compatibility policies are available to support scenarios that need to preserve compatibility with non-secure pages: [InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecureprivatenetworkrequestsallowed) and [InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecureprivatenetworkrequestsallowedforurls).

- **Block mixed content downloads.** Secure pages will only download files hosted on other secure pages, and downloads hosted on non-secure (non-HTTPS) pages will be blocked if initiated from a secure page. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Google security blog entry](https://security.googleblog.com/2020/02/protecting-users-from-insecure_6.html).

- **Enable implicit sign-in for on-premises accounts.**   By enabling the OnlyOnPremisesImplicitSigninEnabled policy, only on-premises accounts will be enabled for implicit sign-in.  Microsoft Edge won't attempt to implicitly sign in to MSA or AAD accounts. Upgrade from on-premises accounts to AAD accounts will be stopped as well.

- **Free form text boxes added to PDF documents.**  We now support adding free form text boxes to PDF documents that you can use to fill in forms and add visible notes.

- **Update your passwords with ease.**  The browser will now take you directly to the Change Password page for a given website saving you time and clicks by avoiding the need to navigate to the page manually. Once you’re on this page the browser will also autofill your existing password and suggest a strong, unique new password.  Please note: currently this feature is available on a limited number of sites.  

- **New accessibility settings page.** We have brought accessibility-related settings together on a single page. You can find the new edge://settings/accessibility page under the main settings list. Here you can find settings to make the web page bigger, show a high visibility outline around the area of focus and other settings that can help improve your web browsing experience. We’ll continue to add new settings here in future versions of Microsoft Edge.

***New Policies***

- [ApplicationGuardPassiveModeEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#applicationguardpassivemodeenabled) Ignore Application Guard site list configuration and browse Edge normally
- [OnlyOnPremisesImplicitSigninEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#onlyonpremisesimplicitsigninenabled) Only on-premises account enabled for implicit sign-in
- [WebRtcRespectOsRoutingTableEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#webrtcrespectosroutingtableenabled) Enable support for Windows OS routing table rules when making peer to peer connections via WebRTC

***Obsoleted Policy***

- [UserAgentClientHintsEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#useragentclienthintsenabled) Enable the User-Agent Client Hints feature

### Feature updates

- **Initial Preferences in Microsoft Edge.**  Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, deploying Microsoft Edge to your enterprise will become easier with the addition of [Initial Preferences](/deployedge/initial-preferences-support-on-microsoft-edge-browser).

- **IE mode on Microsoft Edge will support "no-merge" behavior.**  Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, IE mode on Microsoft Edge will support "no-merge". For an end user, when a new browser window is launched from an IE mode application, it will be in a separate session, similar to the behavior in IE11. You will need to adjust your site list to configure sites that need to prevent session sharing. Behind the scenes, for each window of Microsoft Edge, the first time an IE mode tab is visited within that window, if it is one of the designated “no-merge” sites, that window is locked into a different “no-merge” IE session from all other Microsoft Edge windows at least until the last IE mode tab is closed in that window. Learn more [here](/deployedge/edge-ie-mode-faq#does-ie-mode-on-microsoft-edge-support-the--no-merge--option-that-was-supported-in-internet-explorer-11-).

- **Tab Groups.**  The ability to categorize tabs into user-defined groups helps you more effectively find, switch, and manage tabs across multiple workstreams. To enable this, we are turning on tab grouping beginning with Microsoft Edge version 93.

- **Hide the title bar while using Vertical Tabs.**  Get the extra few pixels back by hiding the browser's title bar, while in Vertical Tabs. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, you can go to edge://settings/appearance and under the Customize Toolbar section select the option to hide the title bar while in Vertical Tab mode.

- **Video Picture in Picture (PiP) from hover toolbar.**  Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, it will become even easier to enter Picture in Picture (PiP) mode. When you hover over a supported video, a toolbar will appear that allows you to view that video in a PiP window.  Note: this is currently available for Microsoft Edge users on macOS.  Check back shortly as we continue our rollout to Windows users.

- **Removal of 3DES in TLS.**  Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, support for the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite will be removed. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6678134168485888). Additionally, in Microsoft Edge version 93, the [TripleDESEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#tripledesenabled) policy will be available to support scenarios that need to preserve compatibility with outdated servers. This compatibility policy will become obsolete and stop working in Microsoft Edge version 95. Ensure that you update affected servers before then.

- **Policies to bypass ClickOnce and DirectInvoke prompts.**  We have updated our policies to enable bypassing ClickOnce's prompts and DirectInvoke's app for specified file types, from specified domains. To do this, you will need to:

  - Enable [ClickOnceEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#clickonceenabled) or [DirectInvokeEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#directinvokeenabled)
  - Enable [AutoOpenFileTypes](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoopenfiletypes) policy and set the list of specific file types that ClickOnce and DirectInvoke should be disabled for
  - Enable the [AutoOpenAllowedForURLs](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoopenallowedforurls) policy and set the list of specific domains that ClickOnce and DirectInvoke will be disabled for

  Note: AutoOpenAllowedForURLs is a supporter policy for AutoOpenFileTypes. If AutoOpenAllowedForURLs is not set and AutoOpenFileTypes is set, then file types listed will automatically open from all URLs.

### Feature updates

- **Natural language search for browser history on the address bar**. Finding the article/website you are looking for is now easier thanks to natural language search right from the address bar. You can find search results based on page content/description/timing (such as "cake recipe from last week") in addition to titles/URL keyword matches alone.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don’t see this feature, please check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Users can easily get to Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 92, users can reload a site in Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge instead of relying on the standalone IE 11 application while waiting for a site to be configured in the Enterprise Mode Site List. Users will be prompted to add the site to their local site list such that navigating to the same page in Microsoft Edge will automatically render in IE mode for the next 30 days. You can use the *[InternetExplorerIntegrationReloadInIEModeAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationreloadiniemodeallowed)* policy to configure this experience and allow access to the IE mode entry points as well as the ability to add sites to the local site list. You can use the *[InternetExplorerIntegrationLocalSiteListExpirationDays](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationlocalsitelistexpirationdays)* policy to adjust the number of days to keep sites on the local site list.
Note that KB5003698 or later is required for Windows 10, version 1909; or KB5003690 or later is required for Windows 10, version 2004, Windows 10, version 20H2, or Windows 10, version 21H1 for the end-to-end experience.

- **MHTML files will default to opening in Internet Explorer mode**. Starting in Microsoft Edge version 92 Stable, MHTML file types will automatically open in Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge instead of the Internet Explorer (IE11) application. This is most commonly observed while trying to view Outlook emails in a browser. This change will occur only if IE11 is the default handler for this file type. If you'd prefer to change this, you can do so prior to installing the Stable version 92 update using [this guidance](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-applicationdefaults#applicationdefaults-defaultassociationsconfiguration).

- **Payment instruments are now synced across devices**. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92, you have the option to synchronize your payment information across your signed in devices.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don’t see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **"Disable developer mode extensions" warning can be permanently dismissed**. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92, you can turn off the warning "Disable developer mode extensions" by clicking on the 'Don't show this again' option.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don’t see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Manage your extensions right from the toolbar**. The all-new extensions menu on the toolbar will allow you to hide/pin extensions easily. The quick links to manage extensions and find new extensions will make it easy for you to find new extensions and manage your existing ones.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don’t see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Automatic HTTPS**. Users will have the option to upgrade navigation from HTTP to HTTPS on domains likely to support this more secure protocol. This support can also be configured to attempt delivery over HTTPS for all domains.
Please note: we are experimenting with this feature and this behavior won’t be seen if you have opted out of experiments.

- **Improvements to font rendering**. Improvements have been made to the rendering of text to improve clarity and reduce blurriness.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don’t see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

### Feature updates

- **Identify network traffic originating from Microsoft Defender Application Guard containers at the proxy level**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, there’s built in support to tag network traffic originating from Application Guard containers, allowing enterprises to identify them and apply specific policies.

- **Support option to allow synchronizing Favorites from the host to the Edge Application Guard container**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, users have the option to configure Application Guard to synchronize their favorites from the host to the container. This ensures new favorites appear on the container as well.

- **Support for Speech Recognition APIs**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, API support for speech recognition commands on Google.com and similar sites will be added. This feature is limited to a randomly selected group of users who have enabled experimentation. These users are giving feedback to the feature team.

- **Personalize your browser with new theme colors**. Make Microsoft Edge your own with one of the fourteen new theme colors on the Settings -> Appearance page. You can also install custom themes from the Microsoft Edge Add-on site. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/make-microsoft-edge-your-own-with-themes/m-p/2083165)

- **Interrupt Downloads** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91 the browser will automatically interrupt downloads of types which could harm your computer if those downloads are started without a user interaction and are not supported by SmartScreen Application Reputation check. Users may override and continue to download by right clicking and choosing “Keep” on the download item.
Enterprise administrators may opt out of this behavior one of these two policies:
    - [ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#exemptdomainfiletypepairsfromfiletypedownloadwarnings) - Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains
For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Security downloads interruptions](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-downloads-interruptions)

## Version 90.0.818.8: March 16

### Feature updates

- **Single Sign On (SSO) is now available for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts and Microsoft Account (MSA) on macOS**. A user signed in on Microsoft Edge on macOS will now get automatically signed into websites that are configured to allow single sign on with Work and Microsoft accounts (for example, bing.com, office.com, msn.com, and outlook.com).

- **Kiosk mode.** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, we have locked down the UI print settings to only allow the configured printers and “Print to PDF” options. We have also done improvements within the assigned access single app kiosk mode to restrict the launch of other applications from the browser. For more information about the kiosk mode features please go [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode#kiosk-mode-supported-features).

- **Printing:**

  - **New print rasterization mode for non-PostScript printers**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, Admins can use a new policy to define print rasterization mode for their users. This policy  controls how Microsoft Edge prints to non-PostScript printers on Windows.  Sometimes print jobs on non-PostScript printers need to be rasterized to print correctly. The print options are Full and Fast.

  - **Additional page scaling options for printing**. Users are now able to customize scaling while printing webpages and PDF documents using additional options. The "Fit to Page" option ensures that the webpage or document is fit into the space available in the selected "Paper size" for printing. The "Actual size" option ensures that there are no changes in the size of the contents being printed regardless of the selected "Paper size".

- **Productivity:**

  - **Autofill suggestions are extended to include address fields content from clipboard**. Clipboard content is parsed when you click on a profile/address field (for example, phone, email, zip code, city, state, etc.) to show as autofill suggestions.

  - **Users can search for autofill suggestions even if a form or field isn’t detected**. Today if you have your information saved on Microsoft Edge, autofill suggestions pop up automatically and help you save time while filling out forms. In cases where autofill misses a form, or if you want to fetch data in forms that don't typically have autofill (like temporary forms), you can search for your information using autofill.

- **Access downloads from a flyout in the menu bar**. Downloads will appear in the top-right corner with all the active downloads in one place. This menu is easily dismissible so users can continue browsing uninterrupted, and they can monitor overall download progress right from the toolbar. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-the-new-downloads-experience/m-p/2111551).
