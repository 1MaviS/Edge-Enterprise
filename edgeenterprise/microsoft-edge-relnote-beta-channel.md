These release notes provide information about new features and non-security updates that are included in the Microsoft Edge Beta Channel. Archived versions of these release notes are available at [Archived release notes for Microsoft Edge Beta Channel](./microsoft-edge-relnote-archive-beta-channel.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Edge Web Platform constantly evolves to improve user experience, security, and privacy. To learn more, see [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes).

## Version 127.0.2651.8: June 21, 2024

Fixed various bugs and performance issues, feature updates, and policy updates.

### Dev Channel updates

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Beta channel release. These notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 127.0.2610.3 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-127-0-2610-3-is-live/m-p/4156565)
- [Dev Channel update to 127.0.2638.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-127-0-2638-2-is-live/m-p/4168541)

**Announcement**

- **SSE3 Requirement.**  Microsoft Edge will stop supporting CPUs that lack SSE3 in Microsoft Edge 128. Devices with such CPUs won't receive any more updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Token Binding.** Token Binding uses cryptographic certificates on both ends of the TLS connection in an attempt to close the security gap of bearer tokens, which might be lost or stolen. We're planning to deprecate Token Binding in Microsoft Edge version 130. The [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#allowtokenbindingforurls) policy is deprecated and will be obsoleted in Microsoft Edge version 130.  

### Feature updates

- **Removal of mutation events.** Support for mutation events was removed. The [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) API can be used instead. Administrators can use the [MutationEventsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#mutationeventsenabled) policy as a temporary workaround. Enterprises should still work to remove their dependencies on these mutation events. For more information, see [Intent to Ship: Deprecate Mutation Events (google.com)](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/jBEISy1p1XU).  

- **Gift Card Redemption History in the Hub.** Users with an MSA or Microsoft Entra ID Linked Account can view and utilize information from gift card redemptions through Pay with Rewards or the Rewards Dashboard. Once a user successfully redeems a gift card with Pay with Rewards, information relating to their gift card (date, card number/pin, redemption status) redemption is added to a Redemption History. This information is located in the Wallet hub. Admins can control availability of this feature using the [EdgeWalletCheckoutEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgewalletcheckoutenabled) policy. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Password Monitor policy update.** When the [PasswordMonitorAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#passwordmonitorallowed) policy is enabled as mandatory, users won't see the consent screen to turn on the feature. Also, when it's set to Mandatory enabled, the UI in Settings will be disabled but remain in the 'On' state, and a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - "This setting is managed by your organization."

### Policy updates

#### Deprecated policies

- [SignInCtaOnNtpEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#signinctaonntpenabled) - Enable sign in click to action dialog (deprecated).  

#### Obsoleted policies

- [ImmersiveReaderPictureDictionaryEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#immersivereaderpicturedictionaryenabled) - Enable Picture Dictionary feature within Immersive Reader in Microsoft Edge (obsolete).

### Feature updates

- **AI theme generator.** Microsoft Edge includes an AI theme generator that allows users to input a text string and generate a series of images to preview as browser themes. Applying the theme includes setting the generated image on the Edge new tab page and applying the image's dominant color to the browser frame.

- **Copilot summarization notification.**  The feature displays an Omnibox notification when users enter into a reading mode eligible page in Edge and offers them the option to open Copilot in the sidebar to generate a summary of the content.  **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout.

You can follow the instructions in [Use Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP)](/purview/endpoint-dlp-using?tabs=purview#create-your-dlp-policy) to create the DLP policy.

### Dev Channel updates

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Beta channel release. The following Dev notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 125.0.2492.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-125-0-2492-1-is-live/m-p/4103542)
- [Dev Channel update to 125.0.2506.0 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-125-0-2506-0-is-live/m-p/4113302)

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Defender Application Guard extension deprecation.** Because Application Guard is deprecated, there won't be a migration to Edge Manifest V3. The corresponding extensions and associated [Windows Store app](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n8gnlc8z9c8?hl=en-us&gl=US) will not be available after May 2024. This affects the following browsers: [Application Guard Extension - Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/application-guard-extensi/mfjnknhkkiafjajicegabkbimfhplplj) and [Application Guard Extension - Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/category/privacy-security/). If you want to block unprotected browsers until you're ready to retire MDAG usage in your enterprise, we recommend using AppLocker policies or [Microsoft Edge management service](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-management-service). For more information, see [Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Defender Application Guard](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-windows-defender-application-guard), [Deprecated features in the Windows client - What's new in Windows](/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features), and [Microsoft Defender Application Guard - Windows Security](/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview).

- **Auto-discarding Sleeping Tabs.** Tabs that have been sleeping for a long time are discarded to save memory. When a user navigates back to a discarded tab, the tab needs to be reloaded. This can be managed through the [AutoDiscardSleepingTabsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autodiscardsleepingtabsenabled) policy. This policy is enabled if the [SleepingTabsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#sleepingtabsenabled) policy is enabled. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **New Workspaces color display: browser window outline.** Workspaces each have a dedicated color, and that color is now displayed as an outline on the browser window. The previous experience applied the color across the entire tab strip in horizontal tab orientation, and across the title bar in vertical tab orientation. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Full Favorites Bar available in Workspaces.** Workspaces now display a user's full set of favorites in the Favorites Bar, with a dedicated workspace folder accessible from the bar. The previous experience replaced the Favorites Bar with the workspace favorites folder. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Policy updates
