## Version 109.0.1518.14: December 7, 2022

### Feature update

- **MSA-AAD Account Linking.** Microsoft is enabling users who have a personal Microsoft account (an MSA) and a Microsoft user account through their work or school (an Azure Active Directory account) to "link" the two types of accounts together. "Linked accounts" means that users will be able to see some of the content from their personal account alongside the tailored content from their work or school account. They're also able to earn Microsoft Rewards points in their personal account from their activities while using their work or school account. More blended experiences may be made available.  For more information, see the [Account Linking FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/account-linking-faq-c66effb9-02e6-49c0-89e1-ae4d8644e6f7) and the [Account Linking IT Admins FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/account-linking-it-admins-faq-72f0dc4e-b632-439e-b90c-347043a7b75a). Tenant admins can learn how to control this feature in the Message Center section of the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Also, this feature can be controlled by using the [LinkedAccountEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#linkedaccountenabled) policy.

- **TLS server certificate verification changes.**  In Microsoft Edge version 110, the certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be decoupled from the host operating systemâ€™s root store.  Instead, the default certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be provided by and shipped with the browser.  The [MicrosoftRootStoreEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#microsoftrootstoreenabled) policy is now available for testing to control when the built-in root store and certificate verifier are used.  Support for the policy is planned for removal in Microsoft Edge version 111.  For more information, see [Changes to Microsoft Edge browser TLS server certificate verification](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-cert-verification).  **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout in Microsoft Edge version 109.  If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.
