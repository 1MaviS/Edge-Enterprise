Applying the theme includes setting the generated image on the Edge new tab page and applying the image's dominant color to the browser frame. Admins can control availability to this feature using the [AIGenThemesEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enables-dall-e-themes-generation) policy.  **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout.

- [Dev Channel update to 125.0.2492.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-125-0-2492-1-is-live/m-p/4103542)
- [Dev Channel update to 125.0.2506.0 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-125-0-2506-0-is-live/m-p/4113302)

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Defender Application Guard extension deprecation.** Because Application Guard is deprecated, there won't be a migration to Edge Manifest V3. The corresponding extensions and associated [Windows Store app](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n8gnlc8z9c8?hl=en-us&gl=US) will not be available after May 2024. This affects the following browsers: [Application Guard Extension - Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/application-guard-extensi/mfjnknhkkiafjajicegabkbimfhplplj) and [Application Guard Extension - Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/category/privacy-security/). If you want to block unprotected browsers until you're ready to retire MDAG usage in your enterprise, we recommend using AppLocker policies or [Microsoft Edge management service](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-management-service). For more information, see [Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Defender Application Guard](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-windows-defender-application-guard), [Deprecated features in the Windows client - What's new in Windows](/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features), and [Microsoft Defender Application Guard - Windows Security](/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview).

- **Auto-discarding Sleeping Tabs.** Tabs that have been sleeping for a long time are discarded to save memory. When a user navigates back to a discarded tab, the tab needs to be reloaded. This can be managed through the [AutoDiscardSleepingTabsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autodiscardsleepingtabsenabled) policy. This policy is enabled if the [SleepingTabsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#sleepingtabsenabled) policy is enabled. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **New Workspaces color display: browser window outline.** Workspaces each have a dedicated color, and that color is now displayed as an outline on the browser window. The previous experience applied the color across the entire tab strip in horizontal tab orientation, and across the title bar in vertical tab orientation. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Full Favorites Bar available in Workspaces.** Workspaces now display a user's full set of favorites in the Favorites Bar, with a dedicated workspace folder accessible from the bar. The previous experience replaced the Favorites Bar with the workspace favorites folder. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Policy updates

#### New policies

- [ImageEditorServiceEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#imageeditorserviceenabled) - Enable the Designer for Image Editor feature
- [ZstdContentEncodingEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#zstdcontentencodingenabled) - Enable zstd content encoding support
- [QRCodeGeneratorEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#qrcodegeneratorenabled) - Enable QR Code Generator

### Feature updates

- **Cross-device Search Query History suggestions.** The existing Search Query suggestions are enhanced with cross-device query history in both Recent Searches and browser searches for enterprise users who enable Edge Sync across devices/browsers. From now on Edge gives you the relevant query history suggestions that you used for previous searches, regardless of where you did it. You can always trust Edge to help you quickly re-find the information that you accessed before.

- **Enterprise secure AI controls in the Microsoft Edge management service.** The Microsoft Edge management service now provides a new dedicated space for admins to manage all AI-related policies in the Edge browser. This helps enhance security and productivity for managed users and devices.

### Dev Channel updates

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Beta channel release. The following Dev notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2438.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2438-2-is-live/m-p/4079136)
- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2450.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2450-2-is-live/m-p/4085888)
- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2464.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2464-2-is-live/m-p/4092459)
- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2478.6 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2478-6-is-live/m-p/4097816)

### Feature updates

- **Email notifications for extension requests in the Microsoft Edge management service.** The Microsoft Edge management service provides admins with the ability to receive email notifications for extensions that their users requested. This helps inform them promptly of any new feedback. **Note:** This experience is in public preview and can be accessed by opting in to targeted release in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Updated default profile pill for EDU users in Edge for Business.** To improve the applicability of the current Edge for Business default visuals, users signed in with an EDU account will see the default profile pill label updated to "School".

- **Desktop Shortcut for New Enterprise Devices.** New Microsoft Enterprise devices running through Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE) for the first time will see a Microsoft Edge desktop shortcut automatically created. This desktop shortcut provides users with an alternative way to access their Microsoft Edge browser without needing to manually pin and configure their set-up.

- **Updated profile options in new profile experience.** Many users unintentionally create empty profiles, cluttering their workspace and impeding their browsing experience. To reduce clutter and the likelihood of profile churn, updated First Run Experience (FRE) string options encourage users to sign-in and meaningfully create profiles for an improved browsing experience, or easily cancel unintentional creation. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Copilot Page Context Policies.** To summarize and answer questions based on page context in Microsoft Edge, Copilot needs to be able to access the page content. We're providing two new policies to offer more flexibility for admins to customize Edge page context access across Copilot chats in Edge sidebar.
   - [CopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotpagecontext) - Control Copilot access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles
   - [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) - Control Copilot with Commercial Data Protection access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles
   - The [DiscoverPageContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#discoverpagecontextenabled) policy is deprecated in Edge version 124 and will be obsoleted in Edge version 127.

- **Inline Compose.** This feature allows users to rewrite text using Copilot. Users can highlight text they'd like to improve when writing in Edge and use the Rewrite tool to iterate with different lengths, formats, and tones. Administrators can control availability using the [ComposeInlineEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#composeinlineenabled) policy.

- **Updates to Settings pages on privacy, security, search, & services.**  To improve ease of use, we're updating Edge settings page into two sections: "Privacy and Security" and "Search and Services." This streamlined approach should enable users to find the settings they're interested in more easily. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Removal of Web SQL.** Web SQL support is fully removed. In prior releases, Web SQL support was disabled by default but could be re-enabled via the [WebSQLAccess policy](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies?branch=pr-en-us-4033#websqlaccess). After this change, there's no longer any mechanism to enable Web SQL support. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, see [Intent to Deprecate and Remove Web SQL](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/fWYb6evVA-w/m/pziWcvboAgAJ).

- **Sidebar Tools App - SpeedTest.**  Adding a SpeedTest answer by default to the Tools app in the Microsoft Edge sidebar.  For more information, see [Manage the sidebar in Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-sidebar).

- **Updated Edge Profile account re-authentication popup when Browser to Web Single-Sign-On (SSO) fails.** Edge provides a browser to Web single sign-on (SSO) capability that lets a user sign in to their Edge Profile with a web account first and then automatically sign them into Microsoft first party websites.

  This is done by saving cached credentials. This approach works until there's an authentication challenge to the cached credentials. A typical scenario is when a user changes their password on a different device. The cached credentials on the current device become outdated and SSO fails. Edge detects this failure and shows a re-authentication popup that prompts the user to update their cached credentials on the current device.

- **Updated profile management and customization controls.** Enhancing the profile management and customization experience through surfaced profile controls and an expanded range of default avatars. With these updates, users can effortlessly tailor their profiles to their preferences and select from a broader collection of profile avatars.

- **Updated UX for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint blocks.** Microsoft Edge now provides a different blocking experience for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint based blocks (Web Content Filtering and Custom Indicators). For more information, see [Web protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/web-protection-overview?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).
