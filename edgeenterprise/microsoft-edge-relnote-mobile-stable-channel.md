# Release notes for Microsoft Edge Mobile Stable Channel

These release notes provide information about new features that are available to work or school accounts, and non-security updates that are included in the Microsoft Edge for Mobile Stable Channel.

To understand Microsoft Edge channels, see the [Overview of the Microsoft Edge channels](./microsoft-edge-channels.md).

All the Stable channel security updates are listed in [Release notes for Microsoft Edge Security Updates](./microsoft-edge-relnotes-security.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For the Stable Channel, updates roll out progressively over one or more days. To learn more, see [Progressive rollouts for Microsoft Edge updates](./microsoft-edge-update-progressive-rollout.md). There might be a delay before the new release is populated to the App Store (iOS) and Google Play (Android).

## Version 114.0.1823.37: June 2, 2023

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

### Policy update

- **iOS Website data store access.** Currently, the persistent data store is only statically used by personal accounts. Because work or school accounts can't use this data store, browsing data rather than cookies are lost when their sessions end. This new policy lets organizations access the data store dynamically, which persists browsing data for work or school accounts, giving users a better browsing experience. For more information, see this policy in [Manage Microsoft Edge on iOS and Android with Intune](/mem/intune/apps/manage-microsoft-edge#ios-website-data-store).
