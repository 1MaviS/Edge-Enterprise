# Ready for Microsoft Edge

The article provides information for the IT Administrator who's planning a Microsoft Edge deployment and needs information about application compatibility and support.

## Web application compatibility and support

To help you plan your deployment of Microsoft Edge, we've compiled a list of web applications that may be in use within your organization. This list lets you determine if the web application is ready for Microsoft Edge, as documented by the web application provider’s public support statement.

### Microsoft testing and certification

Microsoft doesn't test or certify these applications in Microsoft Edge. The list was compiled based on publicly available resources. Always refer to the current provider’s support statement. Some applications may require the use of IE Mode as indicated by the support statement.

The following table lists provider support statements for Microsoft Edge.

| Provider | Product(s) | Support statement |
