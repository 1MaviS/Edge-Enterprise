Fixed various bugs.

### Feature updates

- **Read aloud background play and play in silent mode (iOS and Android)**
  - When playing in the background, users can control Read Aloud (pause, resume, play forwards, or play backwards) via the notification panel and lock screen.
  - When users go to another tab in Microsoft Edge while using Read Aloud, they can use a floating control bar to pause, resume, or close Read Aloud.
  - When a device’s silent toggle is on, it doesn’t affect Read Aloud playback as long as media volume is turned up.
