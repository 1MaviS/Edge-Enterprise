# Need Microsoft Edge for compatibility with modern web sites

The **RedirectIncompatibleSitesFromInternetExplorerToEdgeUXDisabled** policy enables customers using Internet Explorer to continue browsing by automatically redirecting incompatible sites to Microsoft Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 87 or later.

## Overview

Many modern websites have designs that are incompatible with Internet Explorer. Whenever a user visits one of these sites they can be automatically redirected to Microsoft Edge so they can continue their browsing tasks without interruption.

The redirection experience is driven by a list maintained by Microsoft of all sites that show an incompatibility message for Internet Explorer.

## Microsoft Edge in action

When a user goes to site that is incompatible with Internet Explorer several things can happen.

First, they are notified about the website incompatibility and the fact that they're now using Microsoft Edge.

A website incompatibility banner, shown in the next screenshot, appears below the address bar for every redirection.

The website incompatibility banner:

- encourages the user to switch to Microsoft Edge
- offers to make Microsoft Edge as the default browser
- gives the user the option to explore Microsoft Edge.
