# Microsoft browser usage report

In the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, activity reports help you to see how users are using different Microsoft 365 services. See [Activity Reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide).

## Browser usage report

The Microsoft Browser Usage report in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center lets you see if users access Microsoft 365 online services via one of three Microsoft browsers: Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge Legacy, or Microsoft Edge. With proper permissions, you can access the report on the usage dashboard and then see which browsers are used in your organization to access these online services. These report insights can help you migrate your organization to Microsoft Edge. To learn how access and use this report, see [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center - Microsoft browser usage](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/browser-usage-report?view=o365-worldwide).
