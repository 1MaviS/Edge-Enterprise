# Provision favorites for Microsoft Edge

Based on customer feedback, we've made improvements to provisioning favorites. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 85, Admins no longer have to manually craft a file to provision favorites. Admins can add favorites and folders using the Microsoft Edge UI to generate a file that can be exported to a group policy.

This article describes how to provision a set of favorites and folders for your organization. You can use the [Configure favorites](https://docs.microsoft.com//DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#configure-favorites) policy to provision favorites and folders.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 85 or later.

## Prerequisites and recommendations

- Microsoft Edge version 85 with the appropriate administrative template installed for group policies.
- We recommend that you use a new profile in Microsoft Edge to provision these favorites. All favorites that are saved with the profile will be included in the export.  

## Provision favorites and folders

Use the following steps to provision favorites and folders for your users.

1. Go to the Microsoft Edge address bar and type this URL: *edge://flags/#edge-favorites-admin-export*.
2. Under **Favorites configuration export for administrators**, pick **Enabled** from the dropdown list and then click **Restart**.

3. Go to the Favorites management page at *edge://favorites* so you can start adding the favorites and folders that you want to provision.
<!--
4. On the **Favorites bar**, click **Add folder**. The folder structure of favorites that are set in the profile you're using will be reflected in the folder you provision for your users. The next screenshot shows "Managed favorites", the folder we'll use to provision favorites.
