# Provision favorites for Microsoft Edge

This article describes how to provision a set of favorites and folders for your organization. You can use the configure favorites enterprise group policy to provision these favorites and folders.

> This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 85 or later.

## Prerequisites and recommendations
