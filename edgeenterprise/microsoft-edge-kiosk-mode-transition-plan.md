# Create a transition plan for Microsoft Edge kiosk mode

This article describes how Microsoft Edge's built-in password manager provides security for user passwords.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge Stable, Beta and Dev Channels, version 87 or later.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When support ends for Microsoft Edge Legacy on March 9, 2021, this out of support desktop application will be removed and replaced with the new release of Microsoft Edge as part of the Windows Update Tuesday (or “B”) release on April 13, 2021. Because of this, you will need to set up kiosk mode in Microsoft Edge.

## Kiosk mode setup options

You have two options for setting up kiosk mode.

- Option 1 (Recommended): Download and install the new version of Microsoft Edge and set up kiosk mode before to applying the Windows 10 Update Tuesday (or “B”) release to your devices on or after April 13, 2021.
- Option 2: After you apply the Windows 10 Update Tuesday (or “B”) release on or after April 13, 2021, Microsoft Edge Legacy, and its kiosk mode, will no longer be available. You will need to set up kiosk mode in Microsoft Edge to run kiosk scenarios. With this option, you will experience a disruption in your kiosk environment—which is why we strongly recommend Option 1.  

## Kiosk mode setup steps

Use the following steps as a guide  to set up kiosk mode in the new Microsoft Edge.
