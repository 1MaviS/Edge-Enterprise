# Microsoft Edge release schedule

This article describes the release cadence and anticipated release schedule for Microsoft Edge.

## Release cadence

Microsoft provides four options, called channels, to manage how often Microsoft Edge is updated with new features. The Microsoft Edge team plans to push public updates to the Beta and Stable channels every six weeks. For more information about our channels, their release cycle, and support levels, see the [Channel overview](./microsoft-edge-channels.md#channel-overview).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Stable channel version 94, Microsoft Edge is moving to a 4-week major release cycle cadence. However, we recognize that enterprise customers who manage complex environments need more time to plan and test Microsoft Edge updates. To help our enterprise customers who need an extended timeline to manage updates, Microsoft Edge will offer an **Extended Stable option aligned to a longer, 8-week major release cycle**; this option will only be available for customers with managed environments.

## Release schedule

The following table lists the planned release dates for the Beta and Stable channels.

> [!NOTE]
> Release dates are approximate and might vary based on build status.

## Release Process

The trigger for Beta and Stable major releases is an equivalent Chromium release.

## Progressive rollouts

The date reference (Released/Release week) for the Stable channel references the beginning of the progressive roll out.

We use a progressive rollout model which means that new release availability for any given device could be staggered over upcoming days. For more information, see [Progressive rollouts for Microsoft Edge Stable Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-update-progressive-rollout).
